# Typing Objects

Similarly to Arrays, objects play two roles in JavaScript (that are occasionally mixed)

- Records: A fixed number of properties that are known at development time.  Each property can have a different type.

- Dictionaries: An arbitrary number of properties whose names are not known at development time. All properties have the same type.
